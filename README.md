The final report of our project can be found in the folder FINAL_REPORT.  To run the FINAL_REPORT, you need the original prism data sets. We put these files in gitignore since they are too large to push.


The folder Report contains the reports of our individual milestones which we later combined to our final report and saved in a different folder.

Scripts contains our markdowns for milestone 1 and 2. We all worked individually on different milestones. 

In Original_Environment you can find the original datasets that we worked with. 

Bibliography contains our references as bibtex files.
